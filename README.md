# jesse-squats

## Problem Statement:

In today's fast-paced digital age, it can be difficult for users to stay motivated in physical activities like squatting due to lack of clear incentives or competition. This lack of motivation and rewards can lead to a decline in the overall health and fitness level of users. 

Moreover, there is an increasing trend towards digital assets being used as rewards instead of traditional currency, but the tracking and verification process for these assets is not easy nor efficient. The current process involves complex code, which might deter many users from participating.

## Solution:

Jessesquats.xyz aims to solve both issues by introducing a mobile application that tracks squatting activities using a device's built-in sensors and includes a live leaderboard for competition. The real-time tracking feature allows the user to see their progress on the leaderboard, encouraging them to keep up the good work.

Furthermore, every 12 hours, users will receive rewards on chain based on their position in the leaderboard, which eliminates the need for a traditional reward system and makes verification of these assets easier and more accessible for all users. This change from digital assets to physical rewards not only motivates users to continue squatting but also increases user engagement as they can see and feel the satisfaction when they reach new positions on the leaderboard.

Update: 23 Feb 2024:

Continuing on building this. We're getting closer.




Update: 21 Dec 2023:

I'm currently building an on-chain game on Unity with the Dojo Engine. I might even integrate the assets from Jesse's Video within this game. If anyone familiar with Unity / Starknet and wants to contribute to a noble cause. Feel Free to reach out.

Jesse couldn't pronounce "Bharat" so he did 20 swats. 
So I took the video he shared on IPFS and make some music with it. 
We can take this anywhere we want.
Ideas / Proposals / Thoughts:

. Jesse Squats - The PWA:

. Do 10 Squats - Earn 10 Points. (Right now they will have no value, but will give you the dopamine and feel goodness of a cookie

. The Jesse Squat Game - Unity + Dojo Engine + Cartesi (Cartesi is far fetched) however the Dojo + Unity start kit is available on GitHub.

. Open to Ideas!

. We have gold, let's make platinum!
