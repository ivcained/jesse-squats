Update: 21 Dec 2023:

I'm currently building an on-chain game on Unity with the Dojo Engine. I might even integrate the assets from Jesse's Video within this game. If anyone familiar with Unity / Starknet and wants to contribute to a noble cause. Feel Free to reach out. 

Where it all started:

Jesse couldn't pronounce "Bharat" so he did 20 swats. 
So I took the video he shared on IPFS and make some music with it. 
We can take this anywhere we want.
Ideas / Proposals / Thoughts:

. Jesse Squats - The PWA:

. Do 10 Squats - Earn 10 Points. (Right now they will have no value, but will give you the dopamine and feel goodness of a cookie

. The Jesse Squat Game - Unity + Dojo Engine + Cartesi (Cartesi is far fetched) however the Dojo + Unity start kit is available on GitHub.

. Open to Ideas!

. We have gold, let's make platinum!
